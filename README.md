# Developing a Cross-Platform Game

**https://srg774.github.io/solid-eureka/**

Some of the hurdles during development included trying to prevent long button presses to limit jumps. I couldn't get the code generated to sort this out without dozens of attempts. The block logic was tricky to pin down in terms of game-over conditions. I also had another hurdle with dynamic canvas resizing. I got it working and it looked good, but it broke the block generation mechanics, so I couldn't implement it. Instead, I set the resolution to match my own mobile device.

The touch controls on mobile work pretty well, as do the desktop controls. I hope the game itself is intuitive. The sprite bouncing up and down were entirely ChatGPT's choices, picking what it thought was best. These are, of course, classic 8-bit themes and colors, come to think of it.

The sprite art isn't mine but from a freeware site. I wasted hours trying to get the JavaScript code to animate the sprite using a single frame sheet image, but in the end, I quickly cropped out two images (left and right). That's why one sprite is slightly different; I just quickly picked two frames from the walking animation set. I'm sure there's a program that can deal with these sprite sheets.

Anyway, thatâ€™s it. I hope you enjoy it. I think my high score is 199, but I am working toward 450, at which point the scrolling speed increases from 0.5 to 5. I've already found a slight glitch to get more points.

Happy gaming!
